My first bioinformatics project in Python
DNA GC Content Calculator

A Python program that calculates the GC content of a DNA sequence, ensuring only valid nucleotides (A, T, G, C) are used.
Usage

Run the program.
Input a DNA sequence (e.g., "ATGC").
The program calculates and shows the GC content.

Example:
Write a DNA sequence using only nucleotides (A, T, G, C): ATGC
GC content of ATGC is 50.0%

Requirements

    Python 3.x
